        Q: What makes coinchew.com better than all of the other mining calculator sites?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        A: Accuracy, we are so far the only site that uses actually live figures for the price of Bitcoin, Bitcoin mining difficulty, and Bitcoin mining block reward. This means that every time you refresh our website you will get the LATEST figures that influence mining.
        <br/> 
        Other popular mining sites* can take hours to update their bitcoin prices, and as I assume can only be out of lazyness, don't seem to ever update their difficulty values, perhaps the most important factor in bitcoin mining. The only other figure that these sites don't display and don't update is block reward, given, updates only every 2-3 years, yet still is another aspect of Bitcoin mining unnacounted for.
